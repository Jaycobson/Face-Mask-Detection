Covid-19 came as a shock to everyone in the world. Health workers were used to the use of facemasks but it became a necessity during and after covid-19. It is important to wear a facemask to avoid the spread of diseases(air borne). 

The goal of this project is to detect if a person has a face mask on or not. This project can be deployed to companies where the sensor automatically detects a fault from anyone within the premises. Although some people are not comfortable with the face mask because it covers their faces and even prevents people from hearing them clearly but the health is the most important thing to everyone.

I build custom models and also used pretrained models. Some pretrained models performed well such as mobile net architecture. The custom models also gave good accuracy. If you have access to GPU, I encourage you to run for more epochs which takes a longer time but be assured that your model's performance will be better but it could come with the cost of overfitting. Use callbacks to monitor overfitting.

After training, I tested on real life images and the model performed excellently.
